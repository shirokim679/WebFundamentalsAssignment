# WebFundamentalsAssignment
Cloned the repository: I started by cloning the repository from the remote Git repository to my local machine using the git clone command. This created a local copy of the repository for me to work on.

Created a new branch: To work on the assignment, I created a new branch using the git branch command and switched to that branch using git checkout. This allowed me to work independently without affecting the main branch.

Made changes: I edited the index.html file to add my details as instructed. After making the changes, I used git add to stage the modified file for commit.

Committed changes: I created a commit to save my changes using the git commit command. I provided a meaningful commit message to describe the changes I made.

Pushed changes: Once the changes were committed, I pushed my local branch to the remote repository using the git push command. This made my changes available
